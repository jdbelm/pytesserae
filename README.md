# PyTesserae

A Python 3 library for exploring what Tesserae v5 might be like.

This is research code:  APIs will change, support is non-existent, etc.  You have been warned.

## Vision

Previous incarnations of the [Tesserae project](https://github.com/tesserae) have involved complicated setups for managing both the website and the various algorithms used to analyze texts.  This has led to difficulty both for new contributors to join the project and for veterans to try new algorithms.  We hope that v5 will solve this problem, and this repo is a sandbox for dreaming up how v5 might be.
